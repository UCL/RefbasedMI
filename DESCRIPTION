Title: Reference-based imputation for longitudinal clinical trials with protocol deviation

Description: This package imputes missing numerical outcomes for a longitudinal trial with protocol deviations.
    It uses distinct treatment arm-based assumptions for the unobserved data, following the general algorithm 
    of Carpenter, Roger, and Kenward (2013), and the causal model model of White, Royes and Best (2019).
    Sensitivity analysis to departures from these assumptions can be done by the Delta method of Roger.
    The program is derived from the mimix Stata package written by Suzie Cro, with additional coding for
    the causal model and delta method.
    The reference-based methods are jump to reference (J2R), copy increments in reference (CIR), copy reference (CR),
    and the causal model, all of which must specify the reference treatment arm. Other methods are
    missing at random (MAR) and the last mean carried forward (LMCF). Individual-specific imputation methods
    (and their reference  groups) can be specified.
