Description: An implementation of the mimix Stata package written by Suzie Cro. 
    Imputes missing numerical outcomes for a longitudinal trial with protocol deviation
    under distinct treatment arm-based assumptions for the unobserved data,
    following the general algorithm of Carpenter, Roger, and Kenward (2013).
    The imputation methods are missing at random (mar),jump to reference (j2r), 
    last mean carried forward (lmcf),copy increments in reference (cir) and copy refrence (cr).
    Additonal options implement the Causal model (see White, Joseph and Best, 2019) and the Delta method.
    The j2r,cir and cr methods must specify the reference treatment arm.
    Individual-specific imputation methods (and their reference groups) can be specified by including said 
    values as columns in the input data set. Both methods must not be simultaneously specified.
    The M imputed data sets are output concatenated as one large data-set appended to    
    the original unimputed data-set. Conversion to mids data type using the mice package enables
    modelling under Rubin's rules.
