Title: Reference-based imputation for longitudinal clinical trials with protocol deviation

Description: An implementation of the mimix Stata package. Imputes missing numerical outcomes 
    for a longitudinal trial with protocol deviation under distinct treatment arm-based assumptions
    for the unobserved data, following the general algorithm of Carpenter, Roger, and Kenward (2013).
    The imputation methods are missing at random (mar),jump to reference (j2r), 
    last mean carried forward (lmcf),copy increments in reference (cir) and copy refrence (cr).
    As well these options a further option allowing the causal model (see White, Joseph and Best, 2019)
    is implemented. The j2r,cir and cr methods must specify the reference treatment arm.
    Individual-specific imputation methods (and their reference groups) can also be specified by 
    2 columns in the input data set. However this is mutually exclusive of specifying the
    overall method and both should not simultaneously be specified.program Runmimix
    performs major analysis including function mimix the required packages as listed in utilities file,
    outputs the M imputed data sets concatenated as one data-set appended to    
    the original (wide format ) unimputed data-set, convert to mids data type enables
    modelling under Rubin's rules by using the mice functions with,pool.
