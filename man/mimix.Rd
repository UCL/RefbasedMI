\description{
main wrapper for running mimix

similar to the Stata mimix function
}
\details{
This is based on Suzie Cro's Stata program

sets up a summary table based on missing data pattern- mg  mimix_group                                                                   #

reflects the pattern and treatment group configuration of the raw data

then acts as a looping mechanism, norm2 is used as MCMC multivariate normal

The mimix package contains the functions preprodata and preproIndivdata to
process long longitudinal data into wide data format

Also the function Addelta to add delta adjustment to the imputed estimates
